Given the head of a singly linked list, the task is to find the starting point of a loop in the linked list if it exists. Return the starting node if a loop exists; otherwise, return null.


A loop exists in a linked list if some node in the list can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos denotes the index (0-based) of the node from where the loop starts.


Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Input: head -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, pos = 1

Output(value of the returned node is displayed): 2

Explaï»¿nation: The tail of the linked list connects to the node at 1st index.
