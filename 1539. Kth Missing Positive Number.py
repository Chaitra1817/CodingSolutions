Hint

Given an array arr of positive integers sorted in a strictly increasing order, and an integer k.

Return the kth positive integer that is missing from this array.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5
Output: 9
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [1,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,...]. The 5th missing positive integer is 9.

Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [5,6,7,...]. The 2nd missing positive integer is 6.

    def findKthPositive(self, arr: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1

        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            missing = arr[mid] - (mid + 1)
            
            if missing < k:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1

        # After the binary search, `low` is the smallest index where the number of missing integers
        # is at least `k`. Therefore, the `k`-th missing number is in the gap after the last `high` index.
        return low + k
