You are given an integer array nums. In one move, you can pick an index i where 0 <= i < nums.length and increment nums[i] by 1.

Return the minimum number of moves to make every value in nums unique.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: After 1 move, the array could be [1, 2, 3].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,1,2,1,7]
Output: 6
Explanation: After 6 moves, the array could be [3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 7].
It can be shown with 5 or less moves that it is impossible for the array to have all unique values.

    def minIncrementForUnique(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        min_increments = 0

        nums.sort()

        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            # Ensure each element is greater than its previous
            if nums[i] <= nums[i - 1]:
                # Add the required increment to minIncrements
                increment = nums[i - 1] + 1 - nums[i]
                min_increments += increment

                # Set the element to be greater than its previous
                nums[i] = nums[i - 1] + 1

        return min_increments
