A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.

            return n - 1
        
        # Binary search for peak
        low, high = 0, n - 1
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            
            # Check if mid is a peak
            if (mid == 0 or nums[mid] > nums[mid - 1]) and (mid == n - 1 or nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]):
                return mid
            
            # Move to the side with the higher element
            if mid > 0 and nums[mid - 1] > nums[mid]:
                high = mid - 1
            else:
                low = mid + 1
        
        return 0
