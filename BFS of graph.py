'''
Given a undirected graph represented by an adjacency list adj, which is a vector of vectors where each adj[i] represents the list of vertices connected to vertex i. Perform a Breadth First Traversal (BFS) starting from vertex 0, visiting vertices from left to right according to the adjacency list, and return a list containing the BFS traversal of the graph.

Note: Do traverse in the same order as they are in the adjacency list.

Examples:

Input: adj = [[2,3,1], [0], [0,4], [0], [2]]

Output: [0, 2, 3, 1, 4]
Explanation: Starting from 0, the BFS traversal will follow these steps: 
Visit 0 → Output: 0 
Visit 2 (first neighbor of 0) → Output: 0, 2 
Visit 3 (next neighbor of 0) → Output: 0, 2, 3 
Visit 1 (next neighbor of 0) → Output: 0, 2, 3, 
Visit 4 (neighbor of 2) → Final Output: 0, 2, 3, 1, 4

Input: adj = [[1, 2], [0, 2], [0, 1, 3, 4], [2], [2]]

Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Explanation: Starting from 0, the BFS traversal proceeds as follows: 
Visit 0 → Output: 0 
Visit 1 (the first neighbor of 0) → Output: 0, 1 
Visit 2 (the next neighbor of 0) → Output: 0, 1, 2 
Visit 3 (the first neighbor of 2 that hasn't been visited yet) → Output: 0, 1, 2, 3 
Visit 4 (the next neighbor of 2) → Final Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
